Use a hierarchical structure
Begin with the main topic, then move to subtopics, and then to sub-subtopics as needed. Each level should be clearly indented using this pattern:

Main Topic:
- Subtopic
-- Sub-subtopic
--- Detail or explanation
Use indentation and hyphens to express structure
Do not use prose or paragraphs. The entire output should be structured as an indented bullet-point list, making it easy to scan and review.

Provide definitions and explanations at each level
Each topic or algorithm must include a brief, clear description. If relevant, include:

What it does

Where or when it is used

A simple real-world example

Important strengths, weaknesses, or notes

Cover both broad and detailed information
For example, if the topic includes "Supervised Learning," list common algorithms under it, and for each algorithm, include further sub-points explaining its function and use cases.

Avoid unnecessary repetition or filler
Keep the summary concise but complete. Focus on clarity, logical organization, and informativeness.

Use this format as a style guide:

Artificial Intelligence (AI):
- Definition: Machines simulating human-like intelligence (e.g., learning, problem-solving, perception)
- Includes:
-- Machine Learning (ML)
-- Expert Systems
-- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-- Robotics

Machine Learning (ML):
- Definition: Algorithms that learn patterns from data and make decisions with minimal human intervention
- Types:
-- Supervised Learning
--- Data: Labeled (input-output pairs)
--- Goal: Learn a function to predict outputs from inputs
--- Examples: Spam detection, price prediction
--- Common Algorithms:
---- Linear Regression
----- Predicts a continuous output from linear input relationships
----- Example: Predicting house prices from area and number of rooms
----- Simple, fast, and interpretable

Goal:
Produce a structured, study-ready summary. It should read like a clear and comprehensive cheat sheet or lecture outline on the topic.

Lecture content: {lecture}

Return ONLY the hierarchical summary without any explanations or additional text.""")

Main Topic:
- Subtopic
-- Sub-subtopic
--- Detail
Your output should follow these formatting and structural guidelines:

Use the DOT language syntax
Output valid Graphviz DOT code that can be rendered using tools like dot, xdot, or online Graphviz editors.

IMPORTANT SYNTAX RULES:
- Node names must be valid identifiers (letters, numbers, underscores only) or quoted strings
- Use quoted strings for node names with spaces or special characters
- All text content should go in the label attribute, not the node name
- Edges connect node identifiers, not labels or descriptions

Graph orientation
Set the graph direction to left-to-right using rankdir=LR.

Nodes
Each item from the hierarchy should be represented as a separate node. Use shape=box and style=filled, color=lightgray for clarity.

Node naming convention:
- Use simple identifiers like: AI, ML, SupervisedLearning, etc.
- Put the actual text in the label attribute
- Example: SupervisedLearning [label="Supervised Learning\\nTrains on labeled data"];

Edges
Connect nodes based on their parent-child relationships using simple node identifiers.

Example of correct syntax:
digraph TopicSummary {{
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, style=filled, color=lightgray];

    AI [label="Artificial Intelligence"];
    ML [label="Machine Learning"];
    SupervisedLearning [label="Supervised Learning\\nTrains on labeled data"];
    
    AI -> ML;
    ML -> SupervisedLearning;

Goal:
Produce a clean, valid DOT file with proper syntax that accurately reflects the logical structure of the input summary.

EXAMPLE_LECTURE = """Today we're going to talk about something fundamental in physics and chemistry: The States of Matter. At its core, matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. All matter exists in different forms known as states or phases.

1. Classical States of Matter
There are three primary states we encounter in everyday life:

üßä Solid
Shape & Volume: Fixed shape and volume.

Particle Behavior: Particles are tightly packed in a regular pattern and vibrate in place.

Example: Ice, metal, wood.

üíß Liquid
Shape & Volume: Fixed volume but takes the shape of its container.

Particle Behavior: Particles are close together but can move/slide past each other.

Example: Water, oil, alcohol.

üå¨Ô∏è Gas
Shape & Volume: No fixed shape or volume; expands to fill the container.

Particle Behavior: Particles are far apart and move freely at high speeds.

Example: Air, oxygen, carbon dioxide.

2. Other (Less Common) States
Beyond the classical states, scientists recognize other exotic states, especially in advanced physics:

‚ö° Plasma
Found in stars, lightning, and neon signs.

Composed of ionized gas ‚Äî atoms are split into electrons and ions.

Behaves differently due to electrical conductivity and response to magnetic fields.

üß™ Bose‚ÄìEinstein Condensate (BEC)
Discovered in 1995.

Occurs at temperatures near absolute zero.

Particles lose individual identity and behave as one "super-particle."

Shows quantum effects on a macroscopic scale.

3. Transitions Between States
Matter can change from one state to another through phase changes, depending on temperature and pressure:

Melting (solid ‚Üí liquid)

Freezing (liquid ‚Üí solid)

Evaporation/Boiling (liquid ‚Üí gas)

Condensation (gas ‚Üí liquid)

Sublimation (solid ‚Üí gas)

Deposition (gas ‚Üí solid)."""
