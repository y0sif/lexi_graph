EXAMPLE_LECTURE = """Today we're going to talk about something fundamental in physics and chemistry: The States of Matter. At its core, matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. All matter exists in different forms known as states or phases.

1. Classical States of Matter
There are three primary states we encounter in everyday life:

üßä Solid
Shape & Volume: Fixed shape and volume.

Particle Behavior: Particles are tightly packed in a regular pattern and vibrate in place.

Example: Ice, metal, wood.

üíß Liquid
Shape & Volume: Fixed volume but takes the shape of its container.

Particle Behavior: Particles are close together but can move/slide past each other.

Example: Water, oil, alcohol.

üå¨Ô∏è Gas
Shape & Volume: No fixed shape or volume; expands to fill the container.

Particle Behavior: Particles are far apart and move freely at high speeds.

Example: Air, oxygen, carbon dioxide.

2. Other (Less Common) States
Beyond the classical states, scientists recognize other exotic states, especially in advanced physics:

‚ö° Plasma
Found in stars, lightning, and neon signs.

Composed of ionized gas ‚Äî atoms are split into electrons and ions.

Behaves differently due to electrical conductivity and response to magnetic fields.

üß™ Bose‚ÄìEinstein Condensate (BEC)
Discovered in 1995.

Occurs at temperatures near absolute zero.

Particles lose individual identity and behave as one "super-particle."

Shows quantum effects on a macroscopic scale.

3. Transitions Between States
Matter can change from one state to another through phase changes, depending on temperature and pressure:

Melting (solid ‚Üí liquid)

Freezing (liquid ‚Üí solid)

Evaporation/Boiling (liquid ‚Üí gas)

Condensation (gas ‚Üí liquid)

Sublimation (solid ‚Üí gas)

Deposition (gas ‚Üí solid)."""
