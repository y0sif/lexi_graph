Use a hierarchical structure
Begin with the main topic, then move to subtopics, and then to sub-subtopics as needed. Each level should be clearly indented using this pattern:

Main Topic:
- Subtopic
-- Sub-subtopic
--- Detail or explanation
Use indentation and hyphens to express structure
Do not use prose or paragraphs. The entire output should be structured as an indented bullet-point list, making it easy to scan and review.

Provide definitions and explanations at each level
Each topic or algorithm must include a brief, clear description. If relevant, include:

What it does

Where or when it is used

A simple real-world example

Important strengths, weaknesses, or notes

Cover both broad and detailed information
For example, if the topic includes "Supervised Learning," list common algorithms under it, and for each algorithm, include further sub-points explaining its function and use cases.

Avoid unnecessary repetition or filler
Keep the summary concise but complete. Focus on clarity, logical organization, and informativeness.

Use this format as a style guide:

Artificial Intelligence (AI):
- Definition: Machines simulating human-like intelligence (e.g., learning, problem-solving, perception)
- Includes:
-- Machine Learning (ML)
-- Expert Systems
-- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-- Robotics

Machine Learning (ML):
- Definition: Algorithms that learn patterns from data and make decisions with minimal human intervention
- Types:
-- Supervised Learning
--- Data: Labeled (input-output pairs)
--- Goal: Learn a function to predict outputs from inputs
--- Examples: Spam detection, price prediction
--- Common Algorithms:
---- Linear Regression
----- Predicts a continuous output from linear input relationships
----- Example: Predicting house prices from area and number of rooms
----- Simple, fast, and interpretable

Goal:
Produce a structured, study-ready summary. It should read like a clear and comprehensive cheat sheet or lecture outline on the topic.

Lecture content: {lecture}

Return ONLY the hierarchical summary without any explanations or additional text.""")

Main Topic:
- Subtopic
-- Sub-subtopic
--- Detail
Your output should follow these formatting and structural guidelines:

Use the DOT language syntax
Output valid Graphviz DOT code that can be rendered using tools like dot, xdot, or online Graphviz editors.

IMPORTANT SYNTAX RULES:
- Node names must be valid identifiers (letters, numbers, underscores only) or quoted strings
- Use quoted strings for node names with spaces or special characters
- All text content should go in the label attribute, not the node name
- Edges connect node identifiers, not labels or descriptions

Graph orientation
Set the graph direction to left-to-right using rankdir=LR.

Nodes and Color Grouping
Each item from the hierarchy should be represented as a separate node. Use shape=box and style=filled for clarity.

Color scheme for parent-child relationships:
- Nodes that share the same parent should have the same color
- Use these colors in order: lightblue, lightgreen, lightcoral, lightyellow, lightpink, lightcyan, wheat, lavender, mistyrose, honeydew
- Root node(s) should use lightgray
- Apply colors systematically: all children of the first parent get lightblue, all children of the second parent get lightgreen, etc.

Node naming convention:
- Use simple identifiers like: AI, ML, SupervisedLearning, etc.
- Put the actual text in the label attribute
- Example: SupervisedLearning [label="Supervised Learning\\nTrains on labeled data", color=lightblue];

Edges
Connect nodes based on their parent-child relationships using simple node identifiers.

Example of correct syntax with color grouping:
digraph TopicSummary {{
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, style=filled];

    // Root node
    AI [label="Artificial Intelligence", color=lightgray];
    
    // Children of AI (same color group)
    ML [label="Machine Learning", color=lightblue];
    NLP [label="Natural Language Processing", color=lightblue];
    
    // Children of ML (same color group)
    SupervisedLearning [label="Supervised Learning\\nTrains on labeled data", color=lightgreen];
    UnsupervisedLearning [label="Unsupervised Learning\\nFinds patterns in data", color=lightgreen];
    
    // Edges
    AI -> ML;
    AI -> NLP;
    ML -> SupervisedLearning;
    ML -> UnsupervisedLearning;
}} 

Goal:
Produce a clean, valid DOT file with proper syntax that accurately reflects the logical structure of the input summary, with nodes visually grouped by color based on their parent relationships.

EXAMPLE_LECTURE = """Welcome to this short lecture on Artificial Intelligence. Let‚Äôs start with the basics. Artificial Intelligence, or AI, refers to the capability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence‚Äîthings like understanding language, recognizing images, or making decisions. Within AI, one of the most important and widely used branches is Machine Learning, or ML. Machine Learning is all about teaching computers to learn from data. Instead of programming every rule manually, we feed the machine examples, and it learns patterns or rules from that data on its own.

Machine learning comes in several types. The first is supervised learning, where we train the model using labeled data‚Äîthat means we give it both the input and the correct output. For example, if we want to train a model to detect spam emails, we show it lots of examples of emails labeled as ‚Äúspam‚Äù or ‚Äúnot spam,‚Äù and the model learns to predict that label. The second type is unsupervised learning, where the data has no labels at all. The algorithm‚Äôs job is to find hidden patterns or groupings. A good example here would be clustering customers based on their shopping behavior‚Äîwithout knowing their categories beforehand. Then we have semi-supervised learning, which is a mix of both: it uses a small amount of labeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data to improve learning accuracy.

Another major category is reinforcement learning. Here, the model‚Äîor we call it an agent‚Äîlearns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. A classic example is training a robot to walk or teaching an AI to play games like chess or Go. It tries actions, sees the result, and adjusts its behavior over time to maximize rewards.

Now, within machine learning, there's a very powerful subfield called deep learning. Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers, and it has completely transformed what we can do with AI. These deep neural networks are excellent at automatically learning complex features from data, especially in areas like image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding. Deep learning is what powers technologies like self-driving cars, facial recognition, and even language models like ChatGPT.

To summarize: AI is the broad field. Machine learning is a subset that lets computers learn from data. And deep learning is a further subset that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn high-level patterns. Each type of learning‚Äîsupervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement‚Äîhas its strengths depending on the problem you‚Äôre trying to solve. And understanding which one to use is a big part of becoming proficient in AI."""
