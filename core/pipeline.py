Use a hierarchical structure
Begin with the main topic, then move to subtopics, and then to sub-subtopics as needed. Each level should be clearly indented using this pattern:

Main Topic:
- Subtopic
-- Sub-subtopic
--- Detail or explanation
Use indentation and hyphens to express structure
Do not use prose or paragraphs. The entire output should be structured as an indented bullet-point list, making it easy to scan and review.

Provide definitions and explanations at each level
Each topic or algorithm must include a brief, clear description. If relevant, include:

What it does

Where or when it is used

A simple real-world example

Important strengths, weaknesses, or notes

Cover both broad and detailed information
For example, if the topic includes "Supervised Learning," list common algorithms under it, and for each algorithm, include further sub-points explaining its function and use cases.

Avoid unnecessary repetition or filler
Keep the summary concise but complete. Focus on clarity, logical organization, and informativeness.

Use this format as a style guide:

Artificial Intelligence (AI):
- Definition: Machines simulating human-like intelligence (e.g., learning, problem-solving, perception)
- Includes:
-- Machine Learning (ML)
-- Expert Systems
-- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-- Robotics

Machine Learning (ML):
- Definition: Algorithms that learn patterns from data and make decisions with minimal human intervention
- Types:
-- Supervised Learning
--- Data: Labeled (input-output pairs)
--- Goal: Learn a function to predict outputs from inputs
--- Examples: Spam detection, price prediction
--- Common Algorithms:
---- Linear Regression
----- Predicts a continuous output from linear input relationships
----- Example: Predicting house prices from area and number of rooms
----- Simple, fast, and interpretable

Goal:
Produce a structured, study-ready summary. It should read like a clear and comprehensive cheat sheet or lecture outline on the topic.

Lecture content: {lecture}

Return ONLY the hierarchical summary without any explanations or additional text.""")

Main Topic:
- Subtopic
-- Sub-subtopic
--- Detail
Your output should follow these formatting and structural guidelines:

Use the DOT language syntax
Output valid Graphviz DOT code that can be rendered using tools like dot, xdot, or online Graphviz editors.

Graph orientation
Set the graph direction to left-to-right using rankdir=LR.

Nodes
Each item from the hierarchy (main topic, subtopics, details) should be represented as a separate node. Use shape=box and a simple lightgray color fill style for clarity.

Edges
Connect nodes based on their parent-child relationships, following the hierarchy. The edges should represent the "is part of" or "belongs to" relationship.

Node labels
Use the actual text from the summary as node labels. For multiline labels (e.g., descriptions or examples), use \n to format them properly within the node.

Hierarchy traversal
Preserve the hierarchy depth by linking each child node to its immediate parent. Do not skip levels, even if some levels are just categorical.

Example style
Your DOT code should look similar to this:

digraph TopicSummary {{
    rankdir=LR;
    node [shape=box, style=filled, color=lightgray];

    AI [label="Artificial Intelligence (AI)"];
    ML [label="Machine Learning (ML)"];
    AI -> ML;

    Supervised [label="Supervised Learning"];
    ML -> Supervised;

    LinearRegression [label="Linear Regression\nPredicts continuous values"];
    Supervised -> LinearRegression;
}} 
Goal:
Produce a clean, readable DOT file that accurately reflects the logical structure of the input summary. The graph should help someone visually understand the hierarchical relationships between topics, methods, and concepts in AI.

Return ONLY the DOT code without any explanations, additional text, or any ` used for annotating code, so don't put the code inside markdown syntax.""")

EXAMPLE_LECTURE = """Today we're going to talk about something fundamental in physics and chemistry: The States of Matter. At its core, matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. All matter exists in different forms known as states or phases.

1. Classical States of Matter
There are three primary states we encounter in everyday life:

üßä Solid
Shape & Volume: Fixed shape and volume.

Particle Behavior: Particles are tightly packed in a regular pattern and vibrate in place.

Example: Ice, metal, wood.

üíß Liquid
Shape & Volume: Fixed volume but takes the shape of its container.

Particle Behavior: Particles are close together but can move/slide past each other.

Example: Water, oil, alcohol.

üå¨Ô∏è Gas
Shape & Volume: No fixed shape or volume; expands to fill the container.

Particle Behavior: Particles are far apart and move freely at high speeds.

Example: Air, oxygen, carbon dioxide.

2. Other (Less Common) States
Beyond the classical states, scientists recognize other exotic states, especially in advanced physics:

‚ö° Plasma
Found in stars, lightning, and neon signs.

Composed of ionized gas ‚Äî atoms are split into electrons and ions.

Behaves differently due to electrical conductivity and response to magnetic fields.

üß™ Bose‚ÄìEinstein Condensate (BEC)
Discovered in 1995.

Occurs at temperatures near absolute zero.

Particles lose individual identity and behave as one "super-particle."

Shows quantum effects on a macroscopic scale.

3. Transitions Between States
Matter can change from one state to another through phase changes, depending on temperature and pressure:

Melting (solid ‚Üí liquid)

Freezing (liquid ‚Üí solid)

Evaporation/Boiling (liquid ‚Üí gas)

Condensation (gas ‚Üí liquid)

Sublimation (solid ‚Üí gas)

Deposition (gas ‚Üí solid)."""
